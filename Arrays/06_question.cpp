// Given an integer array containing n elements. Find the element in the array for which all the elements to its left are smailler than it and all the elements to the right of it are larger than it.

// Algorithm:

// For each element in our array we find the max element to the left of that element and the minimum element to the right of that element. If our element is greater than the left max and smaller than the right min then we know that this is our answer.
